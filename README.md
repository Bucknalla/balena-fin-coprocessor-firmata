# BalenaFin Co-Processor Firmata (beta)

This is an implementation of the [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) protocol for SiliconLabs BGM111. It is compatible with standard Firmata 2.5.8. Please be aware this **project is in beta release** and is subject to change frequently up until release.

### Installation

#### Dockerfile

The easiest way to install the Firmata application onto your board is to run the [balena application]() provided. This targets the latest verision of the Firmata application. This balena application will run and install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) on your Fin in order to provision the Coprocessor with both a bootloader and the Firmata application.

#### Build & Manually Flash

It is also possible to build the source and manually flash the Coprocessor. At this time, it is recommended that you download and install [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio) in order to build and compile the source. Import this repository into Simplicity and build (the part and board type should already be set). Please use the included Gecko SDK in this repo as it includes additional libraries beyond the standard SDK.
